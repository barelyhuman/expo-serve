# expo-serve

A simple cloned implementation of [expo/custom-expo-updates-server](https://github.dev/expo/custom-expo-updates-server) as a single binary to make it easier to handle the `updates` folder in an existing project

## Things to do

- Write about the flow of the binary
- Add in flags/commands to update the runtime version on the plist and AndroidManifest files
- Add in `init` to handle creation of the above files if they don't exist at all
